I don't watch too much tv but i have my own opinion why the media focus the poverty as individual problem than a society ploblem. I feel that the media believe that everybody can succed no matter what kind of bad addictions or psycological problems eveybody have. We live in a world that every field is so advanced that for example with the advanced medical field and knowledge we can implement the knowledge to remove the addactions to everybody such as drug addition, alcoholic addcition and many more. I want to see the goverment to have unlimited funding for people with any kind of addcitons or psycological problems but if they don't want to change i think nobody else can change them. If you don't want to help yourself nobody can help you. I believe that and may be that is why the media beleives the poverty is individual problem but not a siciety problem. I think everybody in this country can have a normal life but not living in poverty.
